______________________Paddles______________________

- Make a paddle config for initial paddle values used to create it (size/colour etc)
- Move values that are used at runtime (speed) to some other config, perhaps even just initialise 
with x velocity, and then sign flip the velocity.

- Make the paddle_movement system nicer to read.


______________________Collision______________________

- Collision with paddles should give the ball extra velocity in the opposing direction

- Collision with goals should reset the ball



______________________Tests______________________

- Have a test for state changes / setup+cleanup that checks entities/resources have been removed.
