______________________Paddles______________________

- Make the paddle_movement system nicer to read.

-paddles.rs TODO: See about linking resources to state exits



______________________Tests______________________

- Have a test for state changes / setup+cleanup that checks entities/resources have been removed.



______________________Main Menu______________________

- Add nice main menu with click to start or something idk

- Potentially look into making it actually look nice, text fading in and out etc, tweening in general



______________________Game Summary______________________

- New AppState that shows the outcome of the game?



______________________Tweening______________________

- I'm either going to make my own tweening or just use the fully functional library that already exists

- This entire tweening should work with multiple tweens of the same kind, for one entity - it currently doesn't.
- Check if having Entity and commands ruins parallelism, if it does, move the removal of Tween Components into one system
