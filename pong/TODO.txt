______________________Paddles______________________

- Make a paddle config for initial paddle values used to create it (size/colour etc)
- Move values that are used at runtime (speed) to some other config, perhaps even just initialise 
with x velocity, and then sign flip the velocity.

- Make the paddle_movement system nicer to read.

-paddles.rs TODO: See about linking resources to state exits



______________________Collision______________________

- Collision with goals should reset the ball


______________________EnemyAI______________________

- Add in OPTIONAL AI for enemy, so probably config with bool stating if it's coop or AI
- Then run that system only if that config resource is set, then you can switch between mid game too


______________________Tests______________________

- Have a test for state changes / setup+cleanup that checks entities/resources have been removed.


______________________Main Menu______________________

- Add nice main menu with click to start or something idk

- Potentially look into making it actually look nice, text fading in and out etc, tweening in general

______________________Game Summary______________________

- New AppState that shows the outcome of the game?



______________________Tweening______________________

- This entire tweening should work with multiple tweens of the same kind, for one entity - it currently doesn't.
- Check if having Entity and commands ruins parallelism, if it does, move the removal of Tween Components into one system
